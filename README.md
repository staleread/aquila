Implementation of the idea proposed by Puhua Guan in "Cellular Automaton
Public-Key Cryptosystem" paper.

## How it works?

*"Let the ground set be a commutative ring. The enciphering key `E` is a
composition of several time-varying inhomogeneous multifold linear invertible
rules, which is made public. The deciphering key `D`, which is kept private by
the designer, is the set of the in dividual rules in the composite enciphering
function."*
